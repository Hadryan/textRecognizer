# textRecognizer
This project is aimed at developing software that provides the features image file to text file convertor, text file to image file convertor, text file to audio file convertor and image file (containing text) to audio file.

This software mainly used tesseract library to recognize text from image and use file handling to make a text file. For conversion of a text file to image file I use PIL (Python Imaging Library) and for converting text to the audio file I use gTTS (Google-Text-to-Speech) library.

Library Used: Tesseract,
              gTTS (google-Text-To-Speech),
              pyQt5,
              pillow
